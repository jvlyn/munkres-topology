# munkres-topology

Reasonably concise notes sheet based upon the text [Topology, 2e](https://books.google.com/books/about/Topology.html?id=XjoZAQAAIAAJ). Covers the majority of Chapters 1-5 (topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, countability, separability) and Chapter 7 (algebraic topology). Prepared during the course of MATH 5345H, as taught in Fall 2017 at the University of Minnesota. First-version draft (not proof-read!).
